# SemesterProject
## Due the night of the final

This is not the official assignment, but it’s time to start thinking about…

* Start forming your groups. I’m looking for groups of 2-4. 
* Come up with an idea for a project. This should be more extensive than our assigned projects. Should incorporate several Activities, saving state, persistence, menus, and notifications. (You don’t need to know these things right now to plan)

## Deliverables:
* Document detailing the project. Well written description of the purpose along with navigation and persistence details. Team name, team members, and project name should also be included.
* Hand-drawn mockups of the various screenshots along with navigation and menus that will be used.
* Source code on GitHub. I will try to get private repositories for each project.
* A final private demo with the whole team present.
